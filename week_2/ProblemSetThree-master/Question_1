1) Explain the concept of inheritance and how the super keyword is used in Objective C.
An important concept in object oriented programming is DRY or do not repeat yourself.   We can prevent repetition by taking advantages of Inheritance in Objective â€“ C classes.   All classes are subclasses of NSObject.  The two most used methods from NSObject are alloc and init.   Alloc is a class method and Init is an instance method.  NSOject also only has one instance variable called the isa pointer.  This pointer points to Object that created it.  Sending a message to an object causes a search for the method within the class that the isa pointer is referring to.  If the method is not found, then the search continues from super class to super class until it reaches NSObject.   

When you create a custom class, all the methods and instance variables of the superclass that it inherits from are available.  You can also override or add to a method.   Overriding is achieved by declaring the method in the implementation file.  The implementation can then be changed to anything.  However, the return type cannot be changed.  The keyword super, allows you to make additions to the implementation instead of completely overriding.  To user super, you just need to pass a message call with super as the receiver and the inherited method as the selector.   From there, changes can be applied such as adding functions to the return or declaring a different variable name.
